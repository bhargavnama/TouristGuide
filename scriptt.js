                        Kodaikanal tour packages. Kodaikanal is not
                        extensively commercialized like Ooty and it offers a pleasant experience to tourists with
                        relatively less crowd. Kodai Lake, Bryant Park, Coaker's Walk, Bear Shola Falls, Silver Cascade,
                        and Pillar Rocks are the top tourist places
                        in Kodaikanal. Kodaikanal is a place you can go to take a break from the rigours of daily city
                        life, and this hill station lets you sit back and connect with nature as you head out on biking
                        or trekking trails or take a stroll
                        through the vast forests surrounding the town. Dolphin's Nose, and Vattakanal are some of the
                        top trekking places in Kodaikanal.
