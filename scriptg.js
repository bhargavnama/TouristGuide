                    <p>Definitely, one of the most sought-after sports in Goa, the thrill of manoeuvring the azure
                        waters on the high-speed Jet Ski is a feeling that mere words cannot convey. The fast winds
                        gushing through your body make you feel like you're
                        flying and tiny sprinkles of the cool water energize you for more. You can opt to ride with a
                        trainer if you're new to this, or you can choose to go doubles with your friends.

                        50km to see Mangeshi temple and found it to be just another ordinary temple. It can be highly
                        avoidable for tourism purpose. Your precious time can be spent on other things. Note : Please

                    <h2>Portuguese-Indian Restaurants</h2>
                    <p>
                        Food is a major attraction in Goa. This part of India has a distinctive cuisine that blends
                        Portuguese and Goan flavors, setting it apart from all the other food around India. Expect fiery
                        flavors, fresh-caught seafood, and an abundance of coconut in
                        the dishes. You can't leave Goa without trying its signature dish, vindaloo, a super-hot meat
                        curry made with palm vinegar and dried red chili peppers. Hospedaria Venite in the capital of
                        Goa, Panaji, wows tourists with its mouthwatering
                        vindaloo. Dominick, a Benaulim Beach mainstay, is another favorite spot for vindaloo – plus it
                        offers front-row seats for world-class sunsets. Another Goan specialty is xacuti, a rich curry
                        with poppy seeds, chili, and coconut.
                        Try it at Souza Lobo, a beachfront restaurant in Calangute, or Fat Fish, a well-trafficked spot
                        in Baga. Tourists hankering for some fresh seafood are spoiled for choice around Goa. Zeebop, on
                        Utorda Beach, offers delightful fish
                        curry, prawn stew, and mackerel doused with spicy red sauce.
