                    <p>
                        Look for spicy dishes flavoured with tamarind and coconut in Kochi, and don’t be surprised if
                        your dinner is served up on a banana leaf. The region is a major banana-growing area, and
                        traditional Kochi cuisine employs the fruit in many dishes, both sweet and savoury. Coconut
                        water provides a refreshing and sweet contrast to the piquant food.
